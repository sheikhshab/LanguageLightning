# Circular App Prototype Design

Based on the market research and value proposition outlined in the document, here's a prototype design for the Circular App that addresses the identified pain points:

## Core Features to Include in Prototype

1. **USSD/NFC Payment Interface**
2. **Low-Cost Transaction Flow**
3. **Simplified Onboarding Process**
4. **Offline Payment Capability**
5. **Security Features**

## Screen-by-Screen Prototype Flow

### 1. Welcome Screen
- Clean, minimal design with Circular App logo
- Tagline: "Instant, Low-Cost, Secure Offline Payments"
- Two main buttons:
  - "Register" (primary CTA)
  - "Login" (for existing users)
- Small text explaining key benefits: "No POS needed • Works offline • Low fees"

### 2. Simplified Registration Flow
- Step 1: Phone number verification (USSD integration)
- Step 2: Basic KYC (simplified form with minimal fields)
- Step 3: Set up security PIN (4-6 digits)
- Progress indicator showing 3 simple steps

### 3. Main Dashboard
- Balance display at top
- Four main action buttons:
  1. **Receive Payment** (NFC/USSD)
  2. **Send Payment**
  3. **Transaction History**
  4. **Bank Transfer**
- Quick access menu at bottom for:
  - Profile
  - Settings
  - Help/Support

### 4. Receive Payment Screen
- Two options prominently displayed:
  - **Via NFC**: "Tap customer's card to your phone"
  - **Via USSD**: "Dial *123# to generate payment code"
- Visual guide showing how to position cards for NFC
- Estimated fee displayed clearly ("Fee: 0.5%")

### 5. Transaction Confirmation
- Amount received
- From (customer name/number)
- Transaction ID
- Fee deducted
- "Receipt" button to send receipt to customer

### 6. Offline Mode Interface
- Visible indicator when in offline mode
- Simplified interface with core functions
- Queued transactions display (to sync when connection returns)

### 7. Security Features
- PIN required for all transactions
- Visual security indicators (lock icon, encryption status)
- Option for biometric authentication in settings

## Visual Design Elements

- **Color Scheme**: Green (financial trust) + Blue (security) gradient
- **Typography**: Clean, legible sans-serif font
- **Icons**: Simple line icons for universal understanding
- **Illustrations**: Minimal instructional graphics for NFC/USSD processes

## Key Interactions

1. NFC Payment Flow:
   - Merchant selects "Receive Payment"
   - Customer taps card to phone
   - Amount confirmation appears
   - PIN entry required
   - Transaction completes with receipt

2. USSD Payment Flow:
   - Merchant selects "Receive Payment"
   - App generates USSD code or prompts to dial *123#
   - Customer enters code/amount via feature phone
   - Confirmation appears in app

## Unique Value Proposition Visualizations

- Comparison chart showing Circular vs competitors (fees, requirements)
- Animated tutorial showing how NFC replaces POS machines
- Security badge displaying encryption standards

## Next Steps for Prototype Development

1. Create low-fidelity wireframes for the above flows
2. Develop interactive prototype using Figma/Adobe XD
3. Test with small business owners for usability
4. Refine based on feedback, focusing on:
   - Simplifying the NFC payment process
   - Making offline mode more intuitive
   - Enhancing security visibility

This prototype design directly addresses the market gaps identified in the research by focusing on simplicity, offline functionality, and cost-effectiveness while maintaining strong security - the key pain points of the target users in Pakistan.
